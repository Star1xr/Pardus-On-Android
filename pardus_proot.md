### 📲 INSTALLATION PARDUS <a name=installation></a>

First, install pardus and login on proot-distro. 

```
pd install pardus

Change repo with debian, because pardus repo is not working. (If you think that the operating system changes when you change the repo, you are wrong, type neofetch and see.)

```
nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

Add these line to end of file. 

```
deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free
```

Then update packages and install the requred packages. 

```
apt update
apt install sudo nano neofetch ##neofetch is optional.
```

Then install desktops.
